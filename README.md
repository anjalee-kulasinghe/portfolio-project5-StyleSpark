### Live Demo

## UX

The website targets three user groups: admins, registered users, and visitors. It focuses on simplicity and easy navigation, centering on showcasing blog articles related to Sri Lanka.

## User Stories

As the developer, I aimed to secure this travel blog, empowering users to create profiles, share adventures through posts with photos, and interact with each other's content. For deeper exploration, users can search and discover new destinations based on keywords, locations, or trending topics, while admins manage users and curate featured content.

### Strategy

This travel blog serves as a gateway to discover Sri Lanka's hidden beauty through user-generated travel stories and photos. Users can explore new destinations and budget-friendly adventures through search, trending topics, and curated content by admins. The blog leverages SEO and collaborations to reach new explorers and potential travelers.

### Scope

The travel blog focuses on user-generated content, allowing users to create profiles, share stories and photos in blog posts, and interact with each other's content. Search and discovery functionalities help users explore destinations based on keywords, locations, or trends, while admins manage users and curate featured content on the homepage.

### Structure

The website follows a traditional web structure with a persistent top navigation bar allowing access to different sections. It includes sections for Home, Blog, City Guide, Food, Travel Tips, Contact Us, Search, Sign In, Sign Up, and Logout, facilitating easy navigation and user engagement.
